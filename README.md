# Buck-Boost Converter Simulation using Simulink

## Overview

This repository contains a Simulink model for simulating a Buck-Boost Converter. The project involves designing and analyzing the performance of the converter under various load conditions. The Buck-Boost Converter is a DC-DC converter that steps up (boost) or steps down (buck) the input voltage based on the duty cycle of the switching signal. This project assumes an ideal converter for simplicity.

## Project Files

- **`buck_boost.slx`**: The main Simulink model file for the Buck-Boost Converter.
- **`buck_boost.slxc`**: Compiled Simulink cache file for the model.
- **`images/`**: Folder containing screenshots of the waveforms.
  - `input_waveform.png`: Input voltage waveform.
  - `output_waveform.png`: Output voltage waveform.

## Results

Screenshots of the waveforms generated by the simulation are included in the `images/` folder.
